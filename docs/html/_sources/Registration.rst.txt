Registration
==============

Most of the applications require account to collect payments or restrict usage.

Username-Password
-----------------

The most basic way is to use username-password combination, and having email assigned to account to restore
lost password. However, because of email delivery issues it might be better to use SMS instead.

.. automodule:: app.user
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

Social Media
------------

Another common registration method today is to register via a large social media account such as Google or Facebook.
